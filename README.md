# GLoom
OpenGL playground

I just want to toy around with OpenGL. After a CG course using Java I'm inclined to try C++ this time around.
Goals include:
* using modern (3.0+) OpenGL
* simple meshes (Cubes)
* object transformations
* Phong shading & reflection for meshes
* texture mapping
* procedural texturing
* shadow mapping
* complex meshes (read from file, maybe .obj because I already know that one)

For now I want to be able to feed cubes and light sources to a renderer and receive correctly shaded output.
